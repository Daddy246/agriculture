    <h1 id=about>ABOUT</h1>
    <p id=p> Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago.</p>

    <h1 style="color:cyan">Types of Soils</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>sandy soil</li>
      <li>slit soil</li>
      <li>clay soil</li>
      <li>loamy soil</li>

    <h3 style="color:maroon">SANDY SOIL</h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b>The first type of soil is sand. It consists of small particles of weathered rock. Sandy soils are one of the poorest types of soil for growing plants because it has very low nutrients and poor water holding capacity, which makes it hard for the plant's roots to absorb water.</b></p>

 <h3 style="color:maroon"> SLIT SOIL</h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b> Silt is granular material of a size between sand and clay, whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar. Silt may occur as a soil or as sediment mixed in suspension with water and soil in a body of water such as a river. It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body, like mudflows from landslides </b></p>

  <h3 style="color:maroon">CLAY SOIL</h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b>Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soilmaterial containing clay minerals. Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and non–plastic upon drying or firing </b></p>
 <img src="Vasavi/4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
 <h3 style="color:maroon">LOAMY SOIL</h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b> The definition of Loam is soil composed mostly of sand, silt, and a smaller amount of clay. By weight, its mineral composition is about 40–40–20% concentration of sand–silt–clay, respectively </b></p>

 <h1 style="color:turquoise">Types of Farming</h1>
 <ul>
 <li>subsistence farming</li>
 <li>commercial farming </li>
 <li>home farming </li>
 </ul>
 <h3 style="color:chocolate">SUBSISTENCE FARMING <h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b>Subsistence farming is described as family farming because it meets the needs of the farmer’s family. It required a low level of technology and household labour. These types of farming produce small output. They do not use high yielding varieties of old seeds and fertilizer.Facilities like electricity and irrigation are not available for them. Most subsistence farming is done manually.</p></b>
 <img src ="Vasavi/7.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
 <h3 style="color:chocolate">COMMERCIAL FARMING </h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b>In this farming, crops are growing for sale in the market. The main purpose of this farming is to do business. It required large areas and a high level of technology.It’s done with the high cost of tools.</b></p>
 <img src="Vasavi/8.jpg" width="400px" height="300px">
 <h3 style="color:chocolate">HOME FARMING</h3>
 <p style="font-family:courier"><b>Home farming includes terrace farming, gardening.
 It required small space and small tools like a garden rake, pruning shear, etc. This farming has the ability to grow any vegetable, fruits, flowers, and small trees in the same land.This farming is also used as a decorated thing for the home.It required small labour. This farming used as both commercial and subsistence.</p></b>

 <h1 style="color:turquoise">Types of Irrigation</h1>
<p>There are different types of irrigation practised for improving crop yield. These types of irrigation systems are practised based on the different types of soils, climates, crops and resources. The main types of irrigation followed by farmers include<p>

<h3 style="color:crimson">Surface Irrigation
</h3>
<p>In this system, no irrigation pump is involved. Here, water is distributed across the land by gravity.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Localized Irrigation</h3>
<p>In this system, water is applied to each plant through a network of pipes under low pressure.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Sprinkler Irrigation</h3>
<p>Water is distributed from a central location by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or from sprinklers from the moving platform.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Drip Irrigation</h3>
<p>In this type, drops of water are delivered near the roots of the plants. This type of irrigation is rarely used as it requires more maintenance.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Center Pivot Irrigation</h3>
<p>In this, the water is distributed by a sprinkler system moving in a circular pattern.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Sub Irrigation</h3>
<p>Water is distributed through a system of pumping stations gates, ditches and canals by raising the water table.</p>
<h3 style="color:crimson">Manual Irrigation</h3>
<p>This a labour intensive and time-consuming system of irrigation. Here, the water is distributed through watering cans by manual labour.</p>
